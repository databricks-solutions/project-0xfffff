# SQLite Rescue: Backup/restore DB to Unity Catalog Volume for persistence
# across container restarts.
#
# IMPORTANT: Databricks Apps do NOT support FUSE mounts for UC volumes.
# This app uses the Databricks SDK Files API for volume access.
#
# Setup steps:
# 1. Add the Unity Catalog volume as an App resource in the Apps UI
# 2. Grant the app "Can read and write" permission on the volume
# 3. Give it a resource key (e.g., "db_backup_volume")
# 4. Uncomment and configure the env section below
#
# Note: valueFrom provides the volume base path (e.g., /Volumes/catalog/schema/volume).
# The app automatically appends "/workshop.db" to construct the full backup path.
#
# env:
#   - name: SQLITE_VOLUME_PATH
#     valueFrom: db_backup_volume  # Resource key from Apps UI
#   - name: SQLITE_BACKUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES
#     value: "10"  # Backup every 10 minutes (default: 10, 0 to disable)
#
# Alternative: Specify the full path directly (works but less portable):
# env:
#   - name: SQLITE_VOLUME_BACKUP_PATH
#     value: "/Volumes/your_catalog/your_schema/your_volume/workshop.db"
